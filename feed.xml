        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week in course 4 has been very exciting for me!  I’ve beend anticipating the coming of TDD and it finally arrived.  I can read through an existing test and understand what’s going on.  I’m not yet able to say that I can write the types of we worked on this week from start to finish with no help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also enjoyed learning HAML.  I’ve never worked with Haml, but I really like the consiseness of the markup. I heard Hampton Catlin, the creator of Haml and Sass speak at WebAfternoon last year and he is very outspoken.  I’ve signed up for Sass Camp in Atlanta in April.  He is speaking there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week also stretched my Github skills.  I had to learn how to create Pull Requests.  We also worked with Github branches. I learned how to use branch in terminal to change branches and view branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had more learning to do when it came to this blog.  I didn’t have a blog for tech so I decided to leverage my Github account and build the site in Jekyll.  I’ve never used Jekyll before, but after my experience with Haml, I was confident enough to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that Jekyll is designed to create a static pages site.  I is designed to incorporate Sass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeykll supports the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to move on to week two.  I expect there is much more waiting for me to learn! &lt;/p&gt;
